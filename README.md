**Bytecode Virtual Machine**

A lightweight compiler and stack-based virtual machine implemented in C++. The project demonstrates the complete language pipeline — lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, bytecode generation, and execution.

**Features**

• Lexer for tokenizing identifiers, numbers, operators, and keywords.

• Recursive descent parser for AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) construction.
